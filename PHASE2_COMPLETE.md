### üë• Role-Based Access Control
- **Permission-based UI rendering** hiding/showing features by role
- **Dynamic CSS classes** for role-based styling
- **API endpoint protection** with proper authorization headers
- **User menu** showing current user info and role
- **Permission checking** before UI actions

### üåê Frontend API Integration
- **Complete API client** with error handling and retry logic
- **Token management** with automatic refresh
